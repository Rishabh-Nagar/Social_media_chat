Rohit: this essay HAHA\\n28/04/2020, 12:36 pm - Rohit: my midterm oh\\n28/04/2020, 12:36 pm - Ed: Firstly, the Lessig‚Äôs Four Modalities Analysis on the Autonomous driving is social. In the social side, it allows people to be not so worry about road accident that happen very frequent because of the artificial intelligence that are about to predict or calculate the accident automated braking or lane-changing like Telsa car that will happen and also the artificial intelligence are mature enough in . Moreover, it help the social to get from point A to point B faster because of the less traffic with the autonomous driving it will able to help all the vehicles and the driverless car connect to each other to find a optimum rote to get to the location rather than every car go on the same road .By doing this will benefits the social and more people will agree and use autonomous driving car.\\n\\t\\n\\tFurthermore, in the markets of autonomous driving company such as Waymo, Apple, Ford autonomous vehicles and Tesla are actually developing and producing autonomous vehicles.  The markets of autonomous car is going to hits  54.23 Billion dollar by 2026 and this creating more job opportunity for developer in software or data science student to involve. Moreover, it will also help to produce 6.9 Million unit of autonomous car by 2030 this will help the manufacturer car to have a new opportunity in the autonomous driving.\\n\\n\\tIn addition, the architecture of autonomous driving car is there. The technology is undergoes pre- mature state. Company like Tesla and Waymo are actually successful in develop autonomous driving car in level 3 where by for a fully function for autonomous driving or non-human interaction that is level 4. But the architecture of autonomous car is there such as in hardware and software.\\nCompany like Waywo or Tesla are using radar sensor as hardware to have a good view on the distance forward in the condition like light, dark and all the weather condition. Moreover, using Ultrasonic to have a good measure of all the proximity conditions and recognize objects in all conditions that it is safe. In addition, they also build an mature artificial intelligence with a good neural network whereby the neural network able to make a quick decision.\\n\\n\\tLast by least, the law of the autonomous driving that was proposes by Germany on January 25,2017. The proposes law was to have a black box on every autonomous car whether the vehicle is control or not been control by driving system. In addition, it will record all the vehicle requested by passages or the driver. Moreover, it also have law like if someone is injured in an accident due of the autonomous driving or malfunctioning in the car, the victim are allowed to recover 10 million.\\n28/04/2020, 12:36 pm - Ed: i doing essay\\n28/04/2020, 12:36 pm - Rohit: i put dash scare she cant read\\n28/04/2020, 12:37 pm - Rohit: in exam i will put them in 4\\n28/04/2020, 12:37 pm - Ed: ü§£ü§£ü§£\\n28/04/2020, 12:37 pm - Rohit: paragrashs\\n28/04/2020, 12:37 pm - Rohit: each for 1 law\\n28/04/2020, 12:37 pm - Ed: kk\\n28/04/2020, 12:37 pm - Rohit: and remove the dash je\\n28/04/2020, 12:37 pm - Ed: i see\\n28/04/2020, 12:37 pm - Ed: kk\\n28/04/2020, 12:37 pm - Ed: scare le\\n28/04/2020, 12:37 pm - Rohit: yes broski\\n28/04/2020, 12:37 pm - Rohit: get milo now\\n28/04/2020, 12:37 pm - Rohit: or die\\n28/04/2020, 12:37 pm - Rohit: üåäüåäüåä\\n28/04/2020, 12:38 pm - Rohit: ?\\n28/04/2020, 12:38 pm - Rohit: michael say answer must be in paragraphs\\n28/04/2020, 12:39 pm - Rohit: <Media omitted>\\n28/04/2020, 12:39 pm - Ed: so point?\\n28/04/2020, 12:39 pm - Rohit: for backup if cyber laws comes out\\n28/04/2020, 12:39 pm - Ed: thx\\n28/04/2020, 12:40 pm - Rohit: i memang exam all never do points one.
